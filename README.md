# Pong
A clone of Pong using pygame.
There's not much to it, just a simple game with 3 diffeerent settings.


### Easy
As the mode implies, the game is set to easy, meaning the ball and the opponent will move slower. 

### Normal
The default defficulty of the game. Slightly faster than easy mode. 

### Hard
If you're looking for a bit of a challenge. Eveything will move alot faster wich makes it harder to track the ball moving around.


## The opponent
The opponent is currently a hardcoded "bot" that follows the balls height and moves accordingly. It uses a random number to decide if it will move or not, making it miss the ball sometimes.

I'll possibly add an ai in the future, if I'll decide to revisit the project.
